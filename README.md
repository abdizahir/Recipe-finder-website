# React + Vite Project

## Recipe Finder multi-page website

The Recipe Finder is a responsive web application that helps users discover and explore a wide variety of recipes. Users can search, filter, and interact with dynamic recipe content, making it easy to find meals that suit their preferences.
Inspired by cutting-edge design and built with clean, reusable code, the website allows users to explore:

* View the home, about, recipes index, and recipe detail pages
* Search for recipes by name or ingredient
* Filter recipes by max prep or cook time
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
